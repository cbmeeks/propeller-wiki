# propeller-wiki
A copy of [propeller wikispaces](http://propeller.wikispaces.com/) which has an expired subscription and is no longer reachable. 
I'm in the process of converting the wikispaces 'mediawiki' dump to github's markdown flavour, but it a slow going process (too much going on in real life)

go to the [wiki](https://github.com/rosco-pc/propeller-wiki/wiki)
